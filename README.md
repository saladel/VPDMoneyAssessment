## Description
Create a simple iOS app that fetches data from an API and displays it in a
table view. The app should have the following functionality:
- Fetch a list of items from the following API
endpoint:¬†https://api.github.com/repositories
- Parse the JSON response and display the item names in a table view.
- When a user taps on an item, navigate to a detail view controller that
displays more information about the selected item.

## Architecture and Tools Used
- The application is built using Swift and UIKit (Programmatic UI).
- I made use of URLSession for networking.
- I used the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
